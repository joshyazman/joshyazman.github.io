# Hello!
I'm Josh - an Analytics Manager at BlueLabs Analytics, a native Virginian, and a recent Texan. I use quantitative analysis techniques to help progressive candidates, campaigns, and causes make the most of the information available to them and make the best resource allocation decisions possible on tight budgets and timelines. My work at BlueLabs falls into a few buckets:

## Electing Great Candidates
In 2020 I worked with Mike Espy's senate race to develop a workable campaign plan targeting the right voters through the right media to try and flip a tough Old South conservative state for an Black Democratic candidate. While we came up short, Espy ran 3.5 points ahead of the top of the Democratic ticket, more than all but one other senate race in 2020. 

Previously, I advised a local candidate in New York who won a strong re-election despite his district swinging 9 points from Obama to Trump in 2016. My team determined the candidate's underlying support levels, studied the electoral environment in the district, and developed a suite of individual-level models of voter behavior to most efficiently target messaging. 

## Committees and Independent Expenditures  
My first project at BlueLabs was to work as an embedded consultant to the DSCC analytics director. In that capacity I helped coordinate the delivery and implementation of analytics assets including individual models and polls, administering access to key tools like the Civis Platform and Votebuilder, and coaching state data directors on how to implement those models and tools in their programs.

Between federal cycles, I worked with one of the largest independent expenditures investing in Virginia state house races. I worked with them to identify the most competitive races where outside resources could be most impactful. The goal was to support the candidates most likely to help Democrats flip the balance of their chamber to support actions to solve climate change.

## Voter Registration Targeting
Unregistered voters are, by definition, very difficult to find on voter files. I led the development of a product at BlueLabs called *Tallia* which does just this. My team compared US Census Bureau data with data from the voter file to identify which Census blocks, zip codes, counties, and districts presented the best opportunities to grow Democratic vote share through registration. As part of this project I also wrote a detailed memo on existing research into tactics and effects of voter registration activities, which was distributed to a number of grantee organizations supported by the main project funder. 

In campaigns, we directly implemented learnings from this targeting work to identify the most efficient voter registration targets in key Senate races in 2020 for digital outreach as well as field (when viable) and mail.

As a twist on this work I also helped the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) develop and deploy individual-level data assets to their network of property managers to register voters at participating housing complexes. This project sought to directly empower residents in subsidized housing by ensuring they were able and ready to participate in the 2020 elections. My contribution was to help design data intake templates, build a data pipeline to support over 25 participating organizations, and develop custom lists of currently registered voters to the client in a format that they could cross-reference with residency lists to target outreach.

## Message Testing and Targeting
In the run-up to 2020 many organizations were trying to find the most effective ways to talk to disaffected Trump supporters and other segments of potential swing voters. My team conducted a messaging experiment for one of these organizations focused on winning back Trump Defectors in WI, MI, and PA. These were voters who were likely to have voted for Trump but were likely to also have voted for a Democrat in 2018 - a hotly contested voting bloc in 2020. Our experiment tested four video messages in an online survey context and determined segments of voters who a) responded more one message or the other and b) responded to different types of messengers. We identified the right messaging for our target voters _and_ the right messengers.

Once we find the right message and messenger for a candidate, I'm often tasked with targeting mass media communications like zip-targeted digital ads, broadcast TV ads, and even billboards! The goal is to understand the size of your target audience, how much of a given region is made up of target voters, and which voters might backlash - or support your candidate less after hearing their message - and blend those three factors into one final decision. 

## COVID Response
Throughout 2020 I also had the opportunity to apply my targeting skillset to help a global foundation shift food aid resources to the regions in the US where the COVID-19-driven economic collapse has driven the greatest need. Our team overcame several challenges to provide the best estimates of unemployment rates, food insecurity, childhood food insecurity, and healthy food availability at the county level national-wide. We did this by combining a variety of data sources from the several federal government agencies and non-profits like Feeding America and analyzing what makes food insecure parts of the country different from those with better access. 

That summer, as the COVID recession diminished consumer's purchasing power, much of the media's focus on food insecurity was on previously well-off suburbs that suddenly had long lines at the local food pantry. Our research, however, suggested that food insecurity was still in the pandemic era was worst in the places it has always been bad - the Deep South's Black Belt, the Rio Grande Valley and other border regions, Indian Country in the West and Northern Plains, and Appalachia. The pandemic didn't change who was food insecure so much as it left everyone worse off - and those who could least afford the hit bore the brunt of the economic downturn. Our work helped this organization maintain focus on the hardest hit parts of the country in a moment those people needed help the most.

### Prudie Fans Don’t Read Politics, and Other Things We Learned by Analyzing the Habits of Slate Readers
Slate publishes a wide variety of articles ranging from culture and sports to politics and the merits of goat spamming every day. We’ve always been able to sort the more widely read articles from the less popular fare, but we’ve never been able to tell whether the readers who come to us for judicial coverage are also interested in breaking news via Slatest or getting advice columns like Dear Prudence. So we wanted to find out who Slate’s largest and most distinct groups of readers are.

Decision-makers need to understand [sampling] error to make the most of survey results, so it's important for data scientists and analysts to communicate confidence intervals when visualizing estimated results. Confidence intervals are the range of values you could reasonably expect to see in your target population based on the results measured in your sample.

### Everything wrong with Ted Cruz’s voter shaming mailer
Lab and field experiments on social pressure and voting behavior have led to plenty of promising findings about how to increase voter turnout. These efforts sometimes push the envelope on what is acceptable to say to voters to get them to the polls — where the line falls between engagement and harassment, between a nudge and a push. But social scientists have responded to that problem by documenting the effects of blowback so political campaigns don’t overdo their social pressure messaging to the point of turning off voters. Ted Cruz’s mailer is an excellent case study in how not to use social pressure in order to increase voter turnout.

### Why I wish Joe Biden had run for president
Joe Biden is fond of his father’s expressions, repeating on many occasions his dad’s saying that “A father knows he’s a success when he turns and looks at his son or daughter and know that they turned out better than he did.” Here’s my dad’s version: a parent is a success if his kids grow up to serve – in the military, in government, in their communities. I hope one day I can make my dad as proud of his work as Joe Sr. deserves to be. ([more](http://americablog.com/2015/10/why-i-wish-joe-biden-had-run-for-president.html))

### Automatic voter registration in Oregon isn’t enough
Oregon’s move to universal voter registration should be applauded, and I did take a moment to celebrate when I heard of the bill’s passage. But let’s not hold this accomplishment up as the be-all, end-all of voting reforms that will heal our body politic once and for all. Let’s continue the work of forming a more perfect union together – by seeking universal participation so we can finally hear the voices of millions of Americans who have remained quiet for far too long.
