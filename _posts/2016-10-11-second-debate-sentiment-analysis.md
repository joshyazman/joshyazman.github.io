title: Sentiment Analysis from the Second Presidential Debate
---

# Introduction
After reading [this](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) article by David Robinson demonstrating that Donald Trump’s most vitriolic and nasty tweets were coming from his Android while more traditional campaign tweets came from staffers using an iPhone, I’ve been itching for a good excuse to apply Robinson’s sentiment analysis on my own. The second presidential debate offered just such opportunity. All of my code and data are here if you want to follow along at home.

# Who Spoke More?
One of the immediate arguments after each debate is who got to speak more. Luckily just about every media outlet tracked this and determined that speaking time was almost identical with a slight [edge for Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/2016-presidential-debate-speaking-times-229502).

Another way of looking at speaking time is to look at the length of each response. The average word count (illustrated by the diamond on the plot below) was much higher for Clinton than Trump because his responses tended to be short and frequent.
