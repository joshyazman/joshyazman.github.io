# Measuring Message Framing Using Cosine Similarity
Depending on your read of the recently released Mueller Report you probably think that President Donald Trump is either unfit for office, like [Elizabeth Warren](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1119792142577274880), or you may think that Trump is totally exonerated, like… well… [Trump himself](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1124158007921848320). This is because partisans attempt to frame public interpretation of the report through the language they use to discuss it. Framing consists of weighting various decision factors to influence the evaluation of a decision ([Druckman 2010](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/whats-it-all-about-framing-in-political-science)) without changing the utility of the choices offered. Partisans will talk up the parts of the Mueller report that help their party and conveniently forget the parts that don’t - regardless of the contents of the underlying report. **When non-partisan actors adopt the language preferences of one party over the other, we can say that party successfully framed the debate.**

In a recent thesis project I completed for my Masters in Predictive Analytics at Northwestern University, I demonstrated how measures of text similarity can be used to measure partisan framing in transcripts from public affairs shows like Meet the Press. Guests on Meet the Press regularly engage in framing tactics in their responses to questions from journalists. Journalists on Meet the Press, like host Chuck Todd as well as many of his guest panelists, use interviews as a way to provide the public with candid - unframed - images of the candidate’s views and how they stand up to live scrutiny ([Baym 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279653555_Political_Media_as_Discursive_Modes_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Interviews_with_Ron_Paul_from_Meet_the_Press_Tonight_The_Daily_Show_and_Hannity)). When journalists use language that is more similar to one party than the other, the message frames pushed by that party are successful. 

The topics of two recent articles from FiveThirtyEight provide interesting case studies into the uses of text similarity to measure partisan framing:

- Both Parties Think The Mueller Report Was Fair. They Just Completely Disagree On What It Says - by [Drumill Mehta](https://twitter.com/DataDhrumil): [link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/both-parties-think-the-mueller-report-was-fair-they-just-disagree-on-what-it-says/?ex_cid=538twitter)

In this post, I use text similarity measures to demonstrate that *Elizabeth Warren made the best use of her presidential announcement to frame cable news coverage of the presidential race* and that *news outlets framed coverage of the Mueller Report around the second - more incriminating - volume of the report* following its release in mid-April 2019..

## Methodology
I use a method called cosine similarity - a measure of how closely one piece of text reflects another described in the diagram below - to evaluate the relative success of various Democratic candidates in shaping the debate through their announcements. I also use this method to evaluate how cable news channels higlighted or downplayed certain parts of the Mueller Report. 

Cosine similarity considers text to be a vector of words and word counts within a document (ie: a speech, tweet, chyron, etc). To determine the similarity of the direction of the two vectors, you multiply them together to calculate the Dot Product, indicating how similar the two vectors of text are. Consider the following example of comparing the below Tweet from Kamala Harris with a chyron from CNN:

<p>
  <img src="https://github.com/joshyazman/joshyazman.github.io/blob/master/images/message-framing/harris-tweet-orourke-chyron-ex.png#center"/>
</p>

Step 1 of cosine similarity asks us to convert each piece of text into lists of how often each word us used.

<p>
  <img src="https://github.com/joshyazman/joshyazman.github.io/blob/master/images/message-framing/harris-tweet-orourke-chyron-wordvec.png#center"/>
</p>

We then multiply each word count together and add up the results for each word in the vector. See that `about` is used twice in Harris' tweet and zero times in CNN's chyron so the resulting multiplication is `2 x 0 = 0`. Both texts use `returns` once, so the math is `1 x 1 = 1`. After repeating this process for all words used across each text, we add up all the multiplied word counts to get the dot product - a raw measure of how similar our two pieces of text are. In the above example the dot product is `3` because we add up the multiplied word counts for `tax`, `release` and `returns` and the rest of the word counts multiply to zero.

</p>

Finally, the `dot product` is divided by a measure of how large each text string is so that longer texts and shorter texts are more easily comparable. The cosine similarity of each piece of text above is `.147`. 

## Presidential Announcements
One of the goals of a Presidential announcement is to frame coverage of the race in your terms. For example Julian Castro made his announcement in San Antonio - highlighting the city's relative safety and proximity to the Mexican border in an attempt to frame the debate around immigration issues. I use two sources of data to unpack the relative success candidates had using their announcements to frame coverage of the presidential race:
- Candidate Tweets are used as an input representing the purest form of candidate’s messaging. Since Twitter is a controlled communications medium, each candidate’s message will be presented through their tweets without mediation. 
- Cable News Chyrons, the text flashing at the bottom of the screen during cable TV news shows, are used as an input representing media narrative. 

Tweets and chyrons are drawn from teh 5 days before and two days after each candidate's announcements.

If tweets and chyrons become more similar immediately following one’s campaign announcement, then the candidates’ framing efforts worked.

</p>

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren had the best annoucements according to this metric. [put some numbers around that here]. Kirsten Gillibrand had the worst announcement. Prior to announcing, chyrons were much more similar to her tweets than any other candidate's, but after her announcement the similarity dissipated. Her language choices became less represented in media after her announcement than before.

## The Mueller Report
Using the same data set of cable news chyrons, I compare each network's chyrons to both the first and second volume of Mueller's report. [some words on how vol 1 is better for Trump and vol 2 is worse]
