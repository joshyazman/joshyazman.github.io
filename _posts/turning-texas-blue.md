This is a slide deck I've written to outline key demographic trends and opportunities for Texas Democrats in the post-Trump era.

Note: A previous version of this report showed an error in the estimated number of unregistered voters (second-to-last slide). The corrected calculation estimates the number of unregistered voters by subtracting the number of registered voters by county (sourced from the Secretary of State) from the number of citizen voting age people in the county from the 2018 ACS. The earlier slide vastly overestimated the number of potential registrants by subtracting registrants from the total population. As is, the calculation likely underestimates the unregistered population in Texas' rapidly expanding cities and suburbs and overestimates registration potential in rural areas because the baseline population numbers from the Census are 2 years old and Texas's electorate has expanded significantly in that time.
